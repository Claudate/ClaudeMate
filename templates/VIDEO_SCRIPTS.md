**Voiceover:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], creator of ClaudeCode.works - an open-source desktop application that brings a beautiful interface to Anthropic's Claude Code.
>
> If you love Claude's coding capabilities but wish it had better UX, this is for you.
>
> Let me show you what it can do."

*Visual: Fade to application*

---

**[0:20 - 1:00] The Problem We Solve**

*Visual: Terminal showing Claude Code CLI*

**Voiceover:**
> "Claude Code via CLI is incredibly powerful. But it has limitations:
>
> First, conversation history disappears when you close the terminal.
>
> Second, searching through past conversations is nearly impossible.
>
> Third, managing multiple projects requires manual directory navigation.
>
> And fourth, let's be honest - some developers prefer visual interfaces.
>
> ClaudeCode.works solves all of these problems while keeping everything local and secure."

*Visual: Quick flashes of each problem mentioned*

---

**[1:00 - 1:45] Feature 1: Beautiful Interface**

*Visual: Full ClaudeCode.works window*

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's ClaudeCode.works. If you've used VSCode, this layout will feel immediately familiar.
>
> On the left, we have our sidebar with navigation. Main area for conversations. And everything is thoughtfully designed for developers.
>
> Dark mode by default - because, developers - but light mode is available too. Watch."

*Visual: Toggle theme button, smooth transition*

**Voiceover:**
> "Themes switch instantly, and all your syntax highlighting adapts automatically."

---

**[1:45 - 2:30] Feature 2: Persistent Chat History**

*Visual: Chat sidebar showing multiple conversations*

**Voiceover:**
> "Every conversation is automatically saved. Here's my chat history from the past week.
>
> I can click any conversation to jump back in. All my context is preserved.
>
> Let's say I had a conversation about refactoring a React component last Tuesday. Watch how easy it is to find."

*Visual: Click on conversation, it loads*

**Voiceover:**
> "And here it is. All the code suggestions, all the back-and-forth discussion, right where I left it.
>
> I can continue the conversation, export it as Markdown, or start fresh. It's that simple."

*Visual: Show export menu*

---

**[2:30 - 3:10] Feature 3: Powerful Search**

*Visual: Press Cmd+F, search bar appears*

**Voiceover:**
> "But what if I don't remember which conversation had that solution? That's where search comes in.
>
> Command-F brings up the search bar. Let's search for 'async await patterns'."

*Visual: Type query, results appear highlighted*

**Voiceover:**
> "Instantly, every mention across all my conversations is highlighted. I can jump to any result with a click.
>
> This is a game-changer when you're trying to remember how you solved something weeks ago."

*Visual: Click result, conversation opens at that exact message*

---

**[3:10 - 3:50] Feature 4: Multi-Project Management**

*Visual: Project switcher in sidebar*

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's another powerful feature: multi-project management.
>
> I'm currently in my React project. But I also have a Python API I'm working on. Watch how easy it is to switch."

*Visual: Click project dropdown, show list*

**Voiceover:**
> "Command-P brings up the project switcher. Type a few letters, hit Enter, and boom - I'm in my API project. All my conversations for this project are here, completely separate.
>
> No more accidentally mixing contexts or losing track of which Claude conversation belongs to which project."

*Visual: Switch between projects smoothly*

---

**[3:50 - 4:20] Security & Privacy**

*Visual: Settings → Privacy panel*

**Voiceover:**
> "Now, you might be wondering about security and privacy.
>
> Here's what's important: all your data stays local on your computer. We don't have servers collecting your code or conversations.
>
> Your API keys are encrypted using your system's keychain - Keychain Access on Mac, Credential Manager on Windows.
>
> Telemetry is opt-in only. By default, we collect nothing.
>
> And because it's open source, you can audit every line of code on GitHub."

*Visual: Show GitHub repository briefly*

---

**[4:20 - 4:50] Getting Started**

*Visual: Fresh installation screen*

**Voiceover:**
> "Getting started is simple.
>
> Download ClaudeCode.works from our website or use Homebrew.
>
> On first launch, you'll be asked for your Claude API key. If you don't have one, we'll guide you to get it from Anthropic.
>
> Paste it in, optionally open a project folder, and you're ready to code.
>
> The whole setup takes under two minutes."

*Visual: Show setup flow sped up 2x*
